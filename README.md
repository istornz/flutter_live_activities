## üëª Getting started

Due to some **technical restriction**, it's not currently possible to only use Flutter ü´£.

You need to **implement** in your Flutter iOS project a **Widget Extension** & develop in *Swift*/*Objective-C* your own **Live Activity** / **Dynamic Island** design.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can check into the [**example repository**](https://github.com/istornz/live_activities/tree/main/example) for a full example app using Live Activities & Dynamic Island

<br />

- ## üì± Native
  - Create natively your Live Activity view [**tutorial**](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-create-live-activities-widget-for-ios-16-2c07889f1235), you can also create natively a Dynamic Island [**tutorial**](https://medium.com/macoclock/how-to-create-dynamic-island-widgets-on-ios-16-1-or-above-dca0a7dd1483).

  - Enable push notification capabilities.

  <img alt="enable push notification capabilities" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istornz/live_activities/main/.github/images/tutorial/push_capability.gif" width="800px" />

  - Enable live activities for both your **app** & **widget extension**.

  <img alt="enable live activity" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istornz/live_activities/main/.github/images/tutorial/live_activity.png" width="800px" />

  - Create App Group for both ```Runner``` & your widget extension.

  <br />

- ## üíô Flutter

  - Import the plugin.

  ```dart
  import 'package:live_activities/live_activities.dart';
  ```

  - Initialize the Plugin by passing the created **App Group Id** (created above).

  ```dart
  final _liveActivitiesPlugin = LiveActivities();
  _liveActivitiesPlugin.init(appGroupId: "YOUR_CREATED_APP_ID");
  ```

  - Create your dynamic activity.

  ```dart
  final Map<String, dynamic> activityModel = {
    'name': 'Margherita',
    'ingredient': 'tomato, mozzarella, basil',
    'quantity': 1,
  };

  _liveActivitiesPlugin.createActivity(activityModel.toMap());
  ```

  > You can pass all type of data you want but keep it mind it should be compatible with [```UserDefaults```](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults)

  <br />

## Communicate over Native üßµ and Flutter üíô

In order to pass some useful **data** between your **native** live activity / dynamic island with your **Flutter** app you just need to setup **URL scheme**.

- Add a custom url scheme in Xcode by navigating to **Runner** > **Runner** > **URL Types** > **URL Schemes**

<img alt="add url scheme xcode" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istornz/live_activities/main/.github/images/tutorial/url_scheme.png" width="800px" />

- In your Swift code, just create a new **link** and open to your custom **URL Scheme**

```swift
Link(destination: URL(string: "la://my.app/order?=123")!) { // Replace "la" with your scheme
  Text("See order")
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to put the **URL Scheme** you have typed in the **previous step**.

- In your Flutter App, you just need to listen on the **url scheme Scheme**

```dart
_liveActivitiesPlugin.urlSchemeStream().listen((schemeData) {
  // do what do you want here ü§ó
});
```

- [x] Pass data across native dynamic island and Flutter app.
- [x] Pass data across native live activity notification and Flutter app.
- [x] Cancel all activities.
- [x] Get all activities ids.
- [x] Check if live activities are supported.
